                        Your Company</h2>
                    <p class="subtitle">Running your own business can be hugely rewarding, but for many small business owners having the sole responsibility for the<br/> company’s success or failure can take a heavy toll. Did you know that currently over 3 million Australians are livin...</p>

                    <p class="sub_image">Tracking customer event data, such as for Kissmetrics’ behavioral analytics solution, is an integral part to any successful online business–but I bet you already knew that. You might also know that installing Kissmetrics tracking code across your platform is relatively straight forward, though it can get complex depending on your specific requirements.<br/><br>The complexity and management overhead of event tracking can rise quickly when every data-capturing tool your team adds requires developers to implement tracking code for every product. It is time consuming and can take up resources. And no big surprise, this can create friction between marketing and engineering. You definitely knew that… cue engineers and marketers nodding their head slowly…<br/><br/>You install Segment tracking code once and they’ll collect all customer event data and integrate it with all the top applications and send the data to them accordingly. Segment captures data from every customer touch point and then sends your customer data to the tools where it can be used most effectively. Their goal is to take the step of adding and managing unique snippets with each new tool off the table.</p>

You can see usage, configure your cloud settings, add tags for organization, pause, resume devices and much more.  I really enjoy the team here.  We’re getting a ton of stuff done every day and enjoying it a lot.  The atmosphere is relaxed and everyone has their own responsibilities and I think that’s because we all trust each other.  All together, we have a very wide range of skills which is needed in our company because we have such diverse public offerings, ranging from the lowest level hardware to the highest level web applications.  We have to cover all of it, and we do cover it all.  It’s all very impressive.<br/><br/>So, it’s a web application that manages your devices and SIM cards on a nice interface.

This is not easy because we have so much to offer in terms of products, and we’re getting more all the time. The reason I enjoy programming is because I like playing games and I wanted to make my own as a child.
